 <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
 <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan, and add enough water to cover by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes; drain.</li>
 <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil. Brush foil with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
 <li>Transfer potatoes to the prepared baking pan. Use a wide-bottomed glass to lightly press down on each potato to smash to about 1/2-inch thickness, while keeping each potato in one piece.</li>
 <li>Brush smashed potatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. </li>
 <li>Roast in the preheated oven, uncovered, until bottoms are lightly browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. </li>
 <li>Turn potatoes; sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Return to the oven and roast until potatoes are lightly browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes more. </li>
 <li>Preheat the broiler and set a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over potatoes. </li>
 <li>Broil until cheese is golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
